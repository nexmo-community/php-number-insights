# Use Nexmo Number Insights with PHP

This is a very simple demo app showing the [Number Insights API](https://developer.nexmo.com/number-insight/overview) in action.

## Getting Started

First: install dependencies `composer install`

Then: copy `config.php.sample` to `config.php` and edit to add your key and secret (available from the [dashboard](http://dashboard.nexmo.com) and you can sign up there too if you don't have an account).

Finally: change into the `public/` directory and start the webserver with `php -S localhost:8080`
